### Customer Analysis
The customer analysis component seeks to segment customers, track purchasing patterns, and evaluate the profitability of each segment.

## Methodology Adopted
### Data Preparation
Initially, the project undertakes data wrangling to ensure the integrity of the dataset, focusing on the identification and rectification of any missing or NULL values.

Database Construction: A database is assembled with stringent criteria to prevent NULL entries, thereby maintaining data quality.
Feature Expansion: New data columns are introduced to shed light on sales dynamics across different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening), days of the week (Monday to Friday), and months of the year, facilitating a granular time-based analysis.
